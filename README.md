# Whiteboard Problems 
Here are answers to common white board coding problems.  I've done these problems in Javascript and ran them through Node. To test the solutions, run the file with Node and supply pass a test string as a command line argument.

Example:

```bash
    $ node palindrome.js poop

    Output: true

    $ node palindrome.js teststring

    Output: false
```

## Problems

1. String Reversal
    * Problem: Given a string of characters as input, write a function that returns it with the characters reversed.

    * Solution File: stringreversal.js

2. Palindrome
    * Problem: A palindrome is a word or phrase that reads the same backward as forward. Write a function that checks for this.

    * Solution File: palindrome.js

3. Int Reverse
    * Problem: Given an integer, reverse the order of the digits.

    * Solution File: intreverse.js

4. Fizz Buzz
    * Problem: Given a number as an input, print out every integer from 1 to that number. However, when the integer is divisible by 2, print out “Fizz”; when it’s divisible by 3, print out “Buzz”; when it’s divisible by both 2 and 3, print out “Fizz Buzz”.

    * Solution File: fizzbuzz.js

5. Max Character
    * Problem: Given a string of characters, return the character that appears the most often.

    * Solution File: maxcharacter.js

6. Anagrams
    * Problem: Anagrams are words or phrases that contain the same number of characters. Create a function that checks for this.

    * Solution File: anagrams.js

7. Vowels
    * Problem: Given a string of words or phrases, count the number of vowels.

    * Solution File: vowels.js

8. Array Chunking
    * Problem: Given an array and a size, split the array items into a list of arrays of the given size.

    * Solution File: arraychunking.js

9. Reverse Array
    * Problem: Given an array of items, reverse the order.

    * Solution File: reversearray.js

10. Reverse Words
    * Problem: Given a phrase, reverse the order of the characters of each word.

    * Solution File: reversewords.js

11. Capitalization
    * Problem: Given a phrase, capitalize every word.

    * Solution File: capitalization.js

12. Caesar Cipher
    * Problem: Given a phrase, substitute each character by shifting it up or down the alphabet by a given integer. If necessary, the shifting should wrap around back to the beginning or end of the alphabet.

    * Solution File: caesarcipher.js

13. Ransom Note
    * Problem: Given a magazine of words and a ransom note, determine if it’s possible to “cut out” and create the ransom note from the magazine words. In other words, see if all the words in the ransom note are in a giant string of words.

    * Solution File: ransomnote.js

14. Mean, Median, and Mode
    * Problem: Given an array of numbers, calculate the mean, median, and mode.

    * Solution File: mmm.js

15. Two Sum
    * Problem: Given an array of numbers, return all pairs that add up to a given sum. The numbers can be used more than once.

    * Solution File: twosum.js

16. Max Difference
    * Problem: Given a list of numbers, find the two numbers that have the greatest difference.

    * Solution File: maxdifference.js

17. Sieve of Eratosthenes
    * Problem: For a given number, find all the prime numbers from zero to that number.

    * Solution File: NOT CREATED YET

18. Fibonacci
    * Problem: Implement a function that returns the fibonacci number (sum of the previous 2) at a given index.

    * Solution File: NOT CREATED YET

19. Memoized Fibonacci
    * Problem: Implement a performant recursive function for the fibonacci series.

    * Solution File: NOT CREATED YET

20. Staircase
    * Problem: For a given number of steps, print out a “staircase” using hashes and spaces.

    * Example: steps(3), "#  \n## \n###\n"

    * Solution File: NOT CREATED YET

21. Pyramid
    * Problem: For a given number of levels, print out a “pyramid” using hashes and spaces. 

    * Example:   #  \n ### \n#####\n"

    * Solution File: NOT CREATED YET

22. Matrix Spiral
    * Problem: Create a square matrix of a given size in which elements are in spiral order.

    * Example: spiral(3), [[1, 2, 3], [8, 9, 4], [7, 6, 5]]

    * Solution File: NOT CREATED YET
