# Whiteboard Problems

Here are answers to common white board coding problems.  I've done these problems in Javascript and ran them through Node. To test the solutions, run the file with Node and supply pass a test string as a command line argument.

Example:

```bash
    $ node palindrome.js poop

    Output: true

    $ node palindrome.js teststring

    Output: false
```

## Problems

1. String Reversal
    * Problem: Given a string of characters as input, write a function that returns it with the characters reversed.

    * Solution File: stringreversal.js

2. Palindrome
    * Problem: A palindrome is a word or phrase that reads the same backward as forward. Write a function that checks for this.

    * Solution File: palindrome.js
